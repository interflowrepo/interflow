# Interoperability for all users on the Flow blockchain :dizzy:


## What is InterFlow? (and why)

- A mobile app. *(because we want to make it easy)*

- An app to start using quickly, and without complicated steps. *(because we need to make it easy)*

- The place where you can safely view and share your assets (and those of your friends). *(because everyone needs it)*


## What it's *NOT* InterFlow? (and why)

- Another NFT project. *(because we are the centre between all these projects)*

- Another wallet. *(because we are the centre between all these wallets)*

- A social media app. *(because we are more, much more than that)*
